I kept seeing that this is a problem interviewers typically ask their interviewees in coding interviews, so I thought I would give it a try in python. It's pretty short and sweet. I did find as I was running through my first iteration of the code, it wasn't picking up the numbers that were multiples of BOTH 3 and 5. Then I realized (duh) that the if statement addressing both 3 and 5 would need to be at the top of the string of if statements. This is because if it's either a multiple of 3 or 5, one of those is always going to be satisfied before getting to the if statement that tells whether the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
